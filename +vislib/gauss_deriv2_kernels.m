function [k0, k45, k90] = gauss_deriv2_kernels(sd, nsd)
% GAUSS_DERIV2_KERNELS  Second-derivative-of-Gaussian steerable basis kernels.
%   [k0, k45, k90] = vislib.gauss_deriv2_kernels(sd, nsd)
%
%   Returns the 0, 45 and 90 degree second-derivative-of-Gaussian kernels used
%   as the steerable basis for bar/line responses. Each is zero-meaned and
%   normalized to unit energy, except the 45-degree kernel, which is scaled to
%   energy 0.22 for accurate small-kernel steerability (see paper appendix).
%   (Was mk_2dg_sf.m in texture-learning.)
%
%   Inputs
%     sd  - Gaussian standard deviation in pixels.
%     nsd - kernel width in standard deviations.
%
%   Outputs
%     k0, k45, k90 - [sz x sz] basis kernels, sz = nsd*sd.
